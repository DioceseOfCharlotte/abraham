There are a lot of things that go into a well-crafted theme. You need to make sure everything is SEO-friendly, you have to format commonly re-used bits of markup, and now more than ever you need to make it easy for your users to interact with your theme using the WordPress customizer.

The Flagship Library is a project designed to help with these things by delivering a modular, extensible library of reusable theme code. The primary reason it exists is for use in our [premium WordPress themes](https://flagshipwp.com), but we've released it open source for anyone else who would like to use or contribute to it.

For more information about what the library is designed to do and how to use it within a theme, please read our [wiki documentation](https://github.com/FlagshipWP/flagship-library/wiki).
